##Bio

I've spent 10 years working with digital and software teams as a project manager, delivery manager and scrum master. I love working with tech teams and now I want to know how it all works under the hood. So I've set myself a 6 month challenge to learn some of the skills of a software developer and get some hands on experince of coding and using dev tools.

I think my freinds and colleagues would describe me as a pragmatic optimist with a high tolerance for risk and a low tolerance for time wasting.

When I'm working I like a constant supply of black coffee or herbal tea and a bit of classical music playing in the background. 

When I'm not working I like to practise hot yoga, go for a walk in Bushy Park with a good podcast (or good company), hunt down the best ice cream and visit London's Theatreland.
