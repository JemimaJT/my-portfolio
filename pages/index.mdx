# Jemima Tio

## About me

Hi I'm Jemima and  I have spent nearly 20 years working with digital and software teams to build and deliver solutions. But now I want to know how it works under the hood and get some hands on experince of coding myself.

I think my team would describe me as a pragmatic optimist with a high tolerance for risk and a low tolerance for time wasting. When I'm working I like a bit of calming classical music in the background. When I'm not working I love to walk with a good podcast, practise yoga and visit London's Theatreland.
